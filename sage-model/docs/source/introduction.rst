Introduction
============

``SAGE`` is a publicly available code-base for modelling galaxy formation in a
cosmological context. A description of the model and its default calibration
results can be found in `Croton et al. (2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04709>`_.
``SAGE`` is a significant update to that previously used in `Croton et al. (2006) <http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508046>`_.

``SAGE`` is written in C and was built to be modular and customisable.
It will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties.
For testing purposes, treefiles for the `mini-Millennium Simulation <http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504097>`_ are available
`here <https://data-portal.hpc.swin.edu.au/dataset/mini-millennium-simulation>`_.

Galaxy formation models built using ``SAGE`` on the Millennium, Bolshoi and simulations can be downloaded at the
`Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO) <https://tao.asvo.org.au/>`_. You can also find SAGE on `ascl.net <http://ascl.net/1601.006>`_.
